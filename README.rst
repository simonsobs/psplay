A tool to visualize and play with CMB maps. ``psplay`` is a ``jupyter`` extension to allow
interactive visualization of CMB maps through `Leaflet <leafletjs.com>`_ library. ``psplay`` also
provides a set of tools based on `pspy <https://github.com/simonsobs/pspy>`_ to compute and to show
CMB power spectra.

All the specific javascript library developed for ``psplay`` is done by `Sigurd Naess <https://github.com/amaurea>`_.
The build process and javascript architecture is highly inspired by
`ipyleaflet <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet>`_ project.

Examples
--------

* `From simulated CAR map to psplay <https://github.com/xgarrido/psplay/blob/master/examples/car_simulation_to_analysis.ipynb>`_
* `From HEALPIX map file to psplay <https://github.com/xgarrido/psplay/blob/master/examples/healpix_simulation_to_analysis.ipynb>`_

Installation
------------

To install, you will need to have or to install ``numpy``. Then, run

.. code:: shell

   $ pip install psplay [--user]

``psplay`` runs within a Jupyter notebook and we recommend to use JupyterLab to fully enjoy ``psplay``

To enable the extension within Jupyter, you will need to install several JupyterLab extensions
especially the Python ``plotly`` `library <https://plotly.com/python>`_ and the Jupyter `widgets <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets>`_.
For JupyterLab > 2.0.0, you can do

.. code:: shell

   $ jupyter labextension install plotlywidget jupyterlab-plotly
   $ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-sidecar


Finally, you need to install the `jupyter-leaflet-car <https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyter-leaflet-car>`_ extension

.. code:: shell

   $ jupyter labextension install jupyter-leaflet jupyter-leaflet-car


Installation from sources
-------------------------

For a development installation (requires `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>`_)

.. code:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/xgarrido/psplay.git
   $ cd psplay
   $ pip install -e .

If you are using the classic Jupyter Notebook you need to install the nbextension:

.. code:: shell

   $ jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --sys-prefix psplay
   $ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix psplay

If you are using JupyterLab, you need to install the labextension:

.. code:: shell

   $ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager js

Note for developers:

- the ``-e`` pip option allows one to modify the Python code in-place. Restart the kernel in order
  to see the changes.
- the ``--symlink`` argument on Linux or OS X allows one to modify the JavaScript code
  in-place. This feature is not available with Windows.

For automatically building the JavaScript code every time there is a change, run the following
command from the ``psplay/js/`` directory:

.. code:: shell

   $ npm run watch


If you are on JupyterLab you also need to run the following in a separate terminal:

.. code:: shell

   $ jupyter lab --watch


Every time a JavaScript build has terminated you need to refresh the Notebook page in order to load
the JavaScript code again.
